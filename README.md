This is the code for the course about deploying ML-based service with FastAPI and Streamlit on Azure cloud.
In this short course we will build ML-based service on the Azure cloud: stock forecast prediction. 
Our main focus will be on MLE side of the things: we wonâ€™t discuss the modeling, but assume you have already a great ML model and now want to make it available for many users.
We will utilize Docker, FastAPI, Streamlit and, of course, Azure. 

Here is how the output is looking like: interactive Streamlit dashboard on Azure
